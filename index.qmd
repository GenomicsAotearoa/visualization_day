Good visualisation is about more than just writing the correct code. Visualisation is communication, and good communication requires thinking about how we as the scientist/data analyst/creator convey our message to the reader. This one-day workshop will provide you with a toolbox of skills and code examples to help you create clear, visually interesting visualisations which accurately communicate a message. 

## This workshop has five sections

The basic code template for `ggplot2`.

Visualisation for ourselves (exploratory analysis).

Examples of good visualisation (with code).

Iteratively building a figure.

Visualisation from start to finish.




## Why are we doing this? 

Because some plots look like [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PyuGRbqPpjMoswuTMbgOqHfe6Uc-wji7uEJkxyxI9Jw/edit#slide=id.p) (Credit to Dr. Joseph Guhlin for this presentation).

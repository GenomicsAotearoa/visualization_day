Good visualization is about more than just writing the correct code. Visualization is communication, and good communication requires thinking about how we as the scientist/data analyst/creator convey our message to the reader. This one-day workshop will provide you with a toolbox of skills and code examples to help you create clear, visually interesting visualizations which accurately communicate a message. 

## This workshop has four components

The basic code template for ggplot.

Visualization for our selves (exploratory analysis).

Examples of good visualization (with code).

Visualizing your own data.




## Why are we doing this?

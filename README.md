# visualization_day
Visualization is more than just the code used to make a plot.

The aim for this one day workshop is to showcase the full process of visualizing data. This includes some basic exploratory analysis, some minor data transformation, and then thinking about the visual story. Finally, a fully realised visualization will be created. 

In practice, this workshop will be split into four parts:

1. Basic ggplot format and showcase of what can be done.

2. Some data transformations and tidying, viz for exploratory analysis.

3. Group walkthrough of creating a visualization of example data.

4. Working on your own data: plan, transform data, visualize. 

I expect 1. and 3. to lean heavily on tidytuesday visualizations as examples from the community to demonstrate just how far ggplot can be pushed. 

Section 2 and 3 will not be separate blocks, will be interwoven.

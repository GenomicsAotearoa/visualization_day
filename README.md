# From Start to Finish: Visualising your data with ggplot2
Visualisation is more than just the code used to make a plot.

The aim for this one day workshop is to showcase the full process of visualising data. This includes some basic exploratory analysis, some minor data transformation, and then thinking about the visual story. Finally, a fully realised visualisation will be created. 

In practice, this workshop will be split into four parts:

1. Basic ggplot format and showcase of what can be done.

2. Some data transformations and tidying, viz for exploratory analysis.

3. Group walkthrough of creating a visualisation of example data.

4. Working on your own data: plan, transform data, visualise.
